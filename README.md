### **My Engineering Philosophy**  
🚨 *"AI won't fix your broken SLOs or leaky S3 buckets"*  
In an era of relentless automation hype, I focus on:  
- **Measurable reliability** (not just uptime) through SLOs/Error Budgets  
- **Security that's baked in** (not bolted on) via DevSecOps pipelines  
- **Infrastructure that earns its complexity** (Elastic when needed, simple when possible)  

---

### **Where I Excel**  

**🔧 SRE Implementation**  
- Define **meaningful SLOs** that align with business goals  
- Build **error budget-aware** deployment gates  
- Design **multi-region failover** systems that respect SLAs  

**☁️ Elastic Cloud Mastery**  
- AWS/GCP architectures that **scale intelligently**  
- Spot instance strategies with **economic fault tolerance**  
- **Cost-aware autoscaling** that doesn't sacrifice reliability  

**🛡️ Security First Mindset**  
- Infrastructure hardening **before** deployment  
- Regular **penetration testing** (I collaborate with ethical hackers)  
- **Secrets management** that doesn't keep you up at night  

**🚫 Anti-Overengineering**  
- Resist "shiny object syndrome" in tech choices  
- Every component must justify its **operational burden**  
- AI should **augment** your stack, not become your stack

### **Why Work With Me?**  

✅ **Production-Hardened Expertise**  
- Built systems handling **10K+ RPS** while maintaining 99.95% availability  
- Secured **fintech and healthcare** workloads against real-world threats  

✅ **Full-Cycle Ownership**  
- From architecture diagrams to **post-mortem templates**  
- Infrastructure as code **with built-in security controls**  

✅ **Hacker's Perspective**  
- Think like an attacker to **build better defenses**  
- Regular **purple team exercises** to validate security  

✅ **No-Nonsense Approach**  
- Reject "move fast and break things" for **"move deliberately and validate"**  
- **AI-assisted** workflows, not AI-dependent ones
